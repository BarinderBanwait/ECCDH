# Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Protocol

This is a simple implementation of the public-key cryptosystem developed by Diffie and Hellman, using elliptic curves. Open the file ECCDH.sagews, which is a Sage worksheet. 

For those interested in playing with it, an interactive version may be found here:

Note, however, that to play with it, you'll need a CoCalc account, which is free anyway.
